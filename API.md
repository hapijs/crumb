### About

Crumb is used to diminish CSRF attacks using a random unique token that is validated on the server side.

Crumb may be used whenever you want to prevent malicious code to execute system commands, that are performed by HTTP requests. For example, if users are able to publish code on your website, malicious code added by a user could force every other user who opens the page, to load and execute code from a third party website e.g. via an HTML image tag. With Crumb implemented into your hapi.js application, you are able to verify requests with unique tokens and prevent the execution of malicious requests.

### CORS

Crumb has been refactored to securely work with CORS, as [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HTML5_Security_Cheat_Sheet#Cross_Origin_Resource_Sharing) recommends using CSRF protection with CORS.

**It is highly discouraged to have a production servers `cors.origin` setting set to "[\*]" or "true" with Crumb as it will leak the crumb token to potentially malicious sites**


## Usage

```js
  const Hapi = require('@hapi/hapi');
  const Crumb = require('@hapi/crumb');

  const server = new Hapi.Server({ port: 8000 });

  (async () => {
    await server.register({
      plugin: Crumb,

      // plugin options
      options: {}
    });

    server.route({
      path: '/login',
      method: 'GET',
      options: {
        plugins: {
          // route specific options
          crumb: {}
        },
        handler(request, h) {
          // this requires to have a view engine configured
          return h.view('some-view');
        }
      }
    });
  })();
```

## Options

The following options are available when registering the plugin.

### Registration options

  * `key` - the name of the cookie to store the csrf crumb into. Defaults to `crumb`.
  * `size` - the length of the crumb to generate. Defaults to `43`, which is 256 bits, see [cryptile](https://hapi.dev/module/cryptiles/) for more information.
  * `autoGenerate` - whether to automatically generate a new crumb for requests. Defaults to `true`.
  * `addToViewContext` - whether to automatically add the crumb to view contexts as the given key. Defaults to `true`.
  * `cookieOptions` - storage options for the cookie containing the crumb, see the [server.state()](http://hapi.dev/api#-serverstatename-options) documentation of hapi for more information. Default to `cookieOptions.path=/` . **Note that the cookie is not set as secure by default.  It should be set as 'secure:true' for production use.**
  * `headerName` - specify the name of the custom CSRF header. Defaults to `X-CSRF-Token`.
  * `restful` - RESTful mode that validates crumb tokens from *"X-CSRF-Token"* request header for **POST**, **PUT**, **PATCH** and **DELETE** server routes. Disables payload/query crumb validation. Defaults to `false`.
  * `skip` - a function with the signature of `function (request, h) {}`, which when provided, is called for every request. If the provided function returns true, validation and generation of crumb is skipped. Defaults to `false`.
  * `enforce` - defaults to true, using enforce with false will set the CSRFÂ header cookie but won't execute the validation
  * `logUnauthorized` - whether to add to the request log with tag 'crumb' and data 'validation failed' (defaults to false)
  
### Routes configuration

Additionally, some configuration can be passed on a per-route basis. Disable Crumb for a particular route by passing `false` instead of a configuration object.

  * `key` - the key used in the view contexts and payloads for the crumb. Defaults to `plugin.key`.
  * `source` - can be either `payload` or `query` specifying how the crumb will be sent in requests. Defaults to `payload`.
  * `restful` - an override for the server's 'restful' setting. Defaults to `plugin.restful`.
